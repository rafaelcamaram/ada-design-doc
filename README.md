## Core Pillars

[**ADA Design**](https://adadesign.io/) is being built taking into accountancy some core pillars we believe are essential for a successful library.

### Flexibility

We are aware that there're already several libraries available on NPM that provide awesome features and impeccable designs - and we need to be honest in saying that they're doing an awesome job with them - but we wanted to go a little bit further with it. We wanted to create a UI kit that mixes all the awesome components/designs present on these libraries but also with all the power that an accessibility lint can provide you - and, what's best, everything fully interactive with your UI.

Using [**ADA Design**](https://adadesign.io/), you are going to be able to take the advantage of several UI components already built-in in the library that aims to allow us to build your pages faster and improve the ADA score of it. And, if you want to use your own component or some others provided by another library, there is no problem -- You can take advantage of our interactive accessibility analyses even with components that were not built by us.

### Design focused but no limits

We know that when we're trying to build websites quickly, it's pretty useful to use all the components already built-in in the library and take advantage of its design. So, thinking about this, one of our core beliefs is that we need to be design-focused. So you can expect us to provide components with better design quality.

On the other hand, we also know that for larger projects we're tended to use custom designs. Using [**ADA Design**](https://adadesign.io/) we won't face any limitations regarding it. We provide you an awesome design that you can use but you have all the freedom to customize it and use it the way you believe that's better for your project.

[**ADA Design**](https://adadesign.io/) is built on the belief that using Evergreen and contributing to [**ADA Design**](https://adadesign.io/) should be a pleasant experience. We prioritize documentation and all the tools for a solid developer experience.
